<p> I did this project as part of the CodeCademy Frontend Engeneer Path, <br>
  but I did many extra things that were not required, and it was self practice not guided practice, <br> 
  so I consider it more of a personal project, I was just coding for fun</p>

<p> I added my custom favicon, and added some transitions & hover effects <br>
  however I did the project after work, after I have been coding for several hours <br>
  so at some point I just stopped because Iwas getting tired <br>and I have not reivisited the project since.</p>
